Hello. Welcome to my Blog

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/images/Sarath.jpg">

I am a first year Computer Science masters student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I did my bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I have worked for a couple of years at JPMorgan Chase as a quantitative researcher where I developed statistical models for pricing interest rate products.

I am primarily interested in machine learning, algorithms, and distributed systems.
