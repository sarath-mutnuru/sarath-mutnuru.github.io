Hello. Welcome to my Blog

<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/images/Sarath.jpg">

I am a Computer Science masters student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I did my bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I have worked for a couple of years at JPMorgan Chase as a quantitative researcher where I developed statistical models for pricing interest rate products.

### Interests
I am primarily interested in deep learning, NLP, Computer Vision, machine learning, and algorithms. These days I am also dabbling distributed systems, their working and logic seem to be very fascinating. 

### Projects

Currently, I am working on multi-modal Vision and Language models for Visual Question Answering. The notion of large scale pre-train and finetune has resulted in many promising models.
